A note on authorship:
All source artifacts are property of their original author, with
the exclusion of the contents of the patches directory and others
copied from it from time to time. Authorship of the contents of
the patches directory is retained by the Minecraft Forge project.
This is because the patches are partially machine generated
artifacts, and are changed heavily due to the way forge works.
Individual attribution within them is impossible.

Consent:
All contributions to Forge must consent to the release of any
patch content to the Forge project.

A note on infectivity:
The LGPL is chosen specifically so that projects may depend on Forge
features without being infected with its license. That is the 
purpose of the LGPL. Mods and others using this code via ordinary
Java mechanics for referencing libraries are specifically not bound
by Forge's license for the Mod code.

from them. The license to MCP data is not transitive - distribution of this data by

redistributable without permission from the MCP team.

=== Sharing ===
I grant permission for some parts of FML to be redistributed outside the terms of the LGPL, for the benefit of
the minecraft modding community. All contributions to these parts should be licensed under the same additional grant.

=========================================================================
This software includes portions from the Apache Maven project at
http://maven.apache.org/ specifically the ComparableVersion.java code. It is
included based on guidelines at

binary differences and applying them, sourced from the subversion at http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaxdelta/

The only changes are to replace some Trove collection types with standard Java collections, and repackaged.
